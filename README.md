# Random timing assignment

This repository holds the code for our group's random timing assignment.

The code can be run from the command line with: "python pyTiming.py " followed by a list of the websites you want to test

The code may need to be run twice to give an accurate representation of the time it takes to get the numbers,
as app engine websites may need to start up if they are in an idle state
